        <h1>HADES</h1>
        <h2>About the game: </h2>
        <div>Hades is a rogue-like dungeon crawler in which you defy the god of the dead as you hack and slash your way out of the Underworld of Greek myth.</p>
            The reason I enjoy it so much is because the soundtrack is very immersive, and the repetitive nature of it make it interesting and challenging</p>
        </div>
        <h2>The creators</h2>
        <div>The creators of the game are Super Giant Games, a small developer with big ambitions
            They've also developed other games, including Pyre, Transistor and Bastion
        </div>
